				<h3>What is a golden Visa?</h3>
				<br />
				<span>If you would like to live in Spain without undergoing the lengthy process of applying for a residency, the Golden Visa could be perfect for you. <br/>
					It requires you to purchase a property or multiple properties for a total sum of â‚¬500.000 excluding taxes and professional (lawyer) fees. <br/>
					The golden visa is tailored to non-EU citizens who want to have easy travel access to the European Union as well as the ability to live there.<br/>

				<h3>What are the benefits of having a Golden Visa?</h3>
				<br />
				<span>First and foremost, the Golden Visa is a pathway into all European countries; you and your family members can travel to any Schengen area without needing a visa,
					for up to 90 days in a 180-day period.<br/>
					You are not required to live in Spain in order to renew your Golden Visa; however, if you do, you become eligible for permanent residence after 5 years. <br/>
					You are able to apply for Spanish citizenship after 10 years of residence. <br/>
