				<h1>What we do</h1>
				<h3>We combine our in-depth knowledge of Marbella and our expertise in financial modeling</h3>
				<br />
				<span>Traditional real estate agents often do not know how to best advise their clients on property purchases. Their goal is to sell a property they hold or share, 
					and leave it up to the clients to narrow down the selection of properties without offering any advice beyond repeating quotes about monthly rent.
					<br /> <br/> Our job is to narrow down the selection for you and conduct in-depth financial analysis of your top selections to help you pick the right property. 
					<br/> <br />
					<h5>Our goal is to grow together.</h5>
