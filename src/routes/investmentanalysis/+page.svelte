		<h3>How we help you make informed purchasing decisions</h3>
		<br />
		<span>We understand that buying in Marbella can be overwhelming. There are many laws & regulations that need to be considered, whether you are buying as an investment, for your Golden Visa, 
			or as a secondary residence. Whatever the challenge, we will accompany you on this journey.

				<h1>What we do</h1>
				<h3>We combine our in-depth knowledge of Marbella and our expertise in financial modeling</h3>
				<br />
				<span>Traditional real estate agents often do not know how to best advise their clients on property purchases. Their goal is to sell a property they hold or share, 
					and leave it up to the clients to narrow down the selection of properties without offering any advice beyond repeating quotes about monthly rent.
					<br /> <br/> Our job is to narrow down the selection for you and conduct in-depth financial analysis of your top selections to help you pick the right property.
					We can prepare it for your moving-in date or manage its rental for you in your absence.
